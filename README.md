## Code

The `code` folder contains Jupyter notebooks and an R Markdown file used in the empirical analysis and graph generation.

## Figures

The `figures` folder stores all figures generated by the code files. These figures include visualizations and graphs that illustrate key points from the analyses.

## Material

The `material` folder contains supplementary material used for the surveys conducted during the study. This includes images of place (participants had to guess where the image was from), sounds (participants had to guess what soundtrack this was), etc. Some of the material was borrowed from [Stanford's wisdom of crowd experiment](https://github.com/stanford-policylab/wisdom-of-crowds).
