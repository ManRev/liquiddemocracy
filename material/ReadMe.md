# Survey material

- As explained in Table 4 in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11868), the survey was constituted of tasks that each comprise a series of questions. Table 4 outlines the tasks created for the survey experiments (some of which were inspired by [Stanford's wisdom of crowd experiment](https://github.com/stanford-policylab/wisdom-of-crowds)). 

- The list questions comprised in each task are stated in `survey_questions.csv`. The questions sometomes rely on multimedia materials (images or sounds). The folder `survey_material` contains the multimedia material need to reproduce the survey.

- `LD_template.qsf` is the Qualtrics export file with the template to run a *Tracking Truth with Liquid Democracy* survey experiment.
